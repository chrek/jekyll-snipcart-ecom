Beautifully restored 1920s vanity professionally painted in a true black tone and sealed with a satin sheen lacquer for added protection. 

The vanity is constructed of solid wood (walnut) and has a total of 4 dovetailed drawers all in excellent working condition considering the age of the piece. All drawers have been cleaned and sanded down to remove any stains or imperfections. 

The vanity comes with a mirror and original wooden casters. The mirror has some signs of aging consistent with age of the piece but it is still perfectly usable. 

A matching bench is also available for an additional $175.  

* Measurements: 

44”L x 17”D x 31.5”H. 

The mirror measures 22”L x 34”H.
