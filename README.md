# jekyll-snipcart-ecom

## Jekyll e-commerce Site powered with Snipcart store

## What has been implemented

* Snipcart Store to add a Shopping Cart and payment
* Navigation
* custom 404 page
* Use of layouts and include files 
* Combination of Markdown, HTML, and Liquid syntax

## Testing locally

To test the site locally:

From the root of project run the commands:

1. `jekyll build`
2. `jekyll serve`

The site is using a Gemfile, so command like jekyll serve with bundle exec prefixed is appropriate:

- `bundle exec jekyll build`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`
